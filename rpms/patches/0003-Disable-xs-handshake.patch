Subject: [PATCH 3/5] Disable xs handshake

This commit disables the XS handshake.
We can consider reverting it at anytime.

This was required during the B::C development cycle in order
to avoid to rebuild all XS modules ad the perl API version
was bumped with the introduction of Perl_DeclareStaticMemory.

We decided to preserve it as a 'feature' to avoid XS handshake
issued during upcp/updates when bumping the perl version.

As most of the time the XS module might survive, and if that's not
the case it would just crash in a worst way. But this should
reduce the amount of failures during the window timeframe where
we are upgrading perl and some daemons like cpsrvd are still running.
